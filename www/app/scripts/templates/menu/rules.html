        <p>Lygneo is a tic tac toe type game. There are 9 squares of 3 by 3 smaller squares.</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each turn, you mark one of the small squares.</li>
            <li>When you get three in a row on a small square, you’ve won that square.</li>
            <li>To win the game, you need to win three small squares in a row.</li>
            <li><strong>You don’t get to pick which of the nine squares to play on. That’s is based on your opponent’s previous move. Whichever square they picks, that’s the square you must play in next.</strong></li>
            <li>If your opponent sends you to a square that's already been won, you can play anywhere on the square.</li>
            <li>If your opponent sends you to a square that's full, you can play anywhere on the square.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
